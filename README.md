# Map Tile Downloader

This Python script downloads map tiles from Thunderforest's Mobile Atlas for specified regions at multiple zoom levels. It supports resuming downloads by skipping already downloaded files and provides a progress bar to track the download progress. This was designed to make map tiles that are compatible with the Lilygo T-Deck running Ripple. 

## Features

- Download map tiles from Thunderforest's Mobile Atlas
- Specify multiple regions and zoom levels
- Skip already downloaded files
- Progress bar to track download progress
- New utility (KMLtoTiles.py) supports gross parsing of a KML,
  then fetching tiles at waypoints and routes

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library
- `tqdm` library
- For KMLtoTiles: `fastkml` library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fistulareffigy/MTD-Script.git
    cd MTD-Script
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install requests tqdm fastkml
    ```
    Note: fastkml is not required to use `TileDL.py`

## Configuration

1. Obtain an API key from [Thunderforest](https://www.thunderforest.com/docs/apikeys/).

2. Edit the script to include your API key:

    ```python
    api_key = "your_api_key_here"
    ```

3. Specify the regions and zoom levels you want to download in the script:

    ```python
    # Define the bounding boxes and zoom levels
    regions = {
        "southern_ontario": (41.5, -83.5, 45.5, -75.0),
        "las_vegas": (35.5, -116.0, 37.5, -114.0),
        "grand_canyon": (35.5, -113.0, 37.0, -111.0)
    }
    zoom_levels = range(1, 15)  # Focusing on zoom levels 1 to 14
    ```

4. Choose map style

    ```python
    # mapstyle = "cycle"
    # mapstyle = "transport"
    # mapstyle = "landscape"
    # mapstyle = "outdoors"
    # mapstyle = "transport-dark"
    # mapstyle = "spinal-map"
    # mapstyle = "pioneer"
    mapstyle = "mobile-atlas"
    # mapstyle = "neighbourhood"
    # mapstyle = "atlas"
    ```
    

   
   
## Usage (TileDL.py)

The tiles will be saved in a folder named tiles on your desktop, organized by zoom level and tile coordinates.

Run the script to start downloading tiles:

```bash
python TileDL.py
```

## Usage (KMLtoTiles.py)

Run the script to start downloading tiles:

```bash
python KMLtoTiles.py <kmlfile> -k your_api_key_here -o ~/map -s outdoors -m 1000

KMLtoTiles.py [-h]
	      [-k APIKEY]
              [-s {outdoors,mobile-atlas,cycle,transport,landscape,transport-dark,spinal-map,pioneer,neighbourhood,atlas}]
	      [-m MAXTILES] [-o OUTDIR] [--minzoom MINZOOM] [--maxzoom MAXZOOM] [--latrgn LATRGN] [--lonrgn LONRGN]
	      kmlfile

Process KML file into selected tiles

positional arguments:
  kmlfile

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -k APIKEY, --apikey APIKEY
  -s {outdoors,mobile-atlas,cycle,transport,landscape,transport-dark,spinal-map,pioneer,neighbourhood,atlas}, --style {outdoors,mobile-atlas,cycle,transport,landscape,transport-dark,spinal-map,pioneer,neighbourhood,atlas}
  -m MAXTILES, --maxtiles MAXTILES
  -o OUTDIR, --outdir OUTDIR
                        output directory (default: /home/ghn/maps)
  --minzoom MINZOOM     minimum zoom level
  --maxzoom MAXZOOM     maximum zoom level
  --latrgn LATRGN
  --lonrgn LONRGN

```

The map projection used for tilings is [EPSG:3857](https://epsg.io/3857), sometimes called the "Web Mapping System." It is a variation of the [Mercator Projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection). It can be helpful to think of zoom levels as dividing the globe by powers-of-two. This is very straightforward for longitude, but more complex for latitude where the projection plays out.
